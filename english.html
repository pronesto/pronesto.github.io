<H1>Music, poetry and Brazilian culture</H1>

<P>
Hello!... My name is Geraldo Magela Pereira, and I am Brazilian, and so
 is everything you will be able to find on this page. Well, almost
 everything. I like to play piano, and sometimes I try composing some
 songs. I am not a very famous composer any way, otherwise you would
 have heard about me, of course. But I did not make this page to talk
 about me, or my hobbies. This page is a modest, small and simple
 tribute to the Brazilian musical culture. Here you will be able to
 find a lot of midi files containing songs that are part of the
 Brazilian folklore. Some of then are very old, probably older than
 you, and even me (Hey, I am not that old :). And I also believe that
 some of these songs you will hardly find on another sites; so, enjoy
 the opportunity: you can freely download all the songs of this page.
</P>

<P>
The songs are divided by their style. Some of these styles are
 genuinely Brazilian, and others come from other countries, but are
 part of the Brazilian tradition since long ago. Actually, I have put
 here some international songs, that have nothing to do with my
 country, but I found then so beautiful... I could not miss the chance
 to pay a tribute to their authors and singers.
</P>

<P>
Only this page is written in English, so, if you want to navigate across
 the remainder of this site, you should know that <EM>bolero</EM> is the same
 as beguine, <EM>valsa</EM> is the translation of waltz, and <EM>núpcias</EM> is more or
 less the same as marriage; that is to say, <EM>"músicas para casamento"</EM>
 are actually wedding music. The other pages can be described as
 follows:
</P>

<P>
<UL>

<LI>
<A HREF="midi.html">Midi</A>: a small collection of midi files that can be freely downloaded.
 The songs are organized according to their style.

<LI>
<A HREF="poemas.html">Poesias</A>: some poems written by me; all in Portuguese. There are also
 some poems that have not been written by me, but that I enjoy a lot.

<LI>
<A HREF="letras.html">Letras</A>: the lyrics of some Brazilian traditional songs. Those are
 really hard to find, so I would give it a look, if I was you.

<LI>
<A HREF="eu.html">Eu</A>: hum... more or less the same of what was written here, but in
 Portuguese, this time. I personally think Portuguese is a wonderful
 way to express. Everybody should know a bit about writers such as
 Camões, Machado de Assis and Fernando Pessoa.

<P>
I sincerely hope you enjoy my home page. You can take anything you
 find here, for your enjoyment, or simply for your curiosity. As a
 final remark, I really enjoy receiving mails from other people;
 therefore, if you want, please, write to me, and tell me what are your
 impressions about my page and songs.
